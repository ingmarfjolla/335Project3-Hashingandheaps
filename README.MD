Challenges:

Linear/Quadratic Probing:
I didn't have too much trouble with the linear and quadratic probing. Really the only issues came from the namespace in the quadratic that i tried to use in 
linear but it didn't really work out.

Double hashing:
I didnt realize we had to manipulate create and test hash cc to take another command line argument, so i spent a few hours trying to figure out
where the r value would come from, then how to send it to the double hashing.h. The actual math behind the function was not too complicated and i udnerstood it relatively easily. I did hwoever have weird trouble with my counting probes this time around and i was outputting wrong

spell check.cc:
Most of my trouble came from outputting. going through the strings wasnt bad. interesting how we used a hash table though.
